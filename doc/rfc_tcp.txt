1.  Introduction

    This document describes how the Babel Protocol session is mapped
    onto a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection. And another
    User Datagram Protocol (UDP) connection to manage game operations.

1.1.    Conventions Used in This Document

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. TCP Session Management
    Mapping Babel session management facilities onto the TCP service is
    straightfoward. An Babel session first requires creation of a TCP
    connection between two peers, one that initiates the connection
    request and one that responds to the connection request. The
    initialising peer is called the "client", and the responding peer is
    called the "server". An Babel server MUST listen for a TCP
    connection requests on a standard TCP port.

    The client MUST issue an active OPEN call, specifying the TCP port
    number on which the server is listening for Babel connection
    attempts. The Babel server MUST return an Babel <WELCOME> to the
    client after the TCP session has been established.

RFC 42              Babel communication protocol            October 2013

    An Babel session is normally ended by the client issuing an Babel
    <logout> command.  A server receiving an Babel <logout> command MUST
    end the Babel session and close the TCP connection with a CLOSE
    call. A client MAY end an Babel session by issuing a CLOSE call.
    
    A server MAY limit the life span of an established TCP connection.
    Babel sessions that are inactive for more than a server-defined
    period MAY be ended by a server issuing a CLOSE call.  A server MAY
    also close TCP connections that have been open and active for longer
    than a server-defined period.

3. TCP Message Exchange

    An Babel client streams Babel commands to an Babel server on an
    established TCP connection. A client MUST NOT distribute commands
    from a single Babel session over multiple TCP connections. A client
    MAY establish multiple TCP connections to support multiple Babel
    sessions with each session mapped to a single connection. A server
    SHOULD limit a client to a maximum number of TCP connections based
    on server capabilities and operational load.

    Babel describes client-server interaction as a command-response
    exchange. A client might be able to realize a slight performance
    gain by pipelining (sending more than one command before a response
    for the first command is received) commands with TCP transport, but
    this feature does not change the basic single command, single
    response operating mode of the core protocol.

    A server SHOULD impose a limit on the amount of time required for a
    client to issue a well-formed Babel command. A server SHOULD end an
    Babel session and close an open TCP connection if a well-formed
    command is not received within the time limit.

    Each Babel data unit MUST contain a single Babel message. commands
    MUST be processed independently and in the same order as sent.

4. TCP Data Unit Format

    The Babel data unit contains two fields: a 32-bits header that
    describes the total length of the message field and the command code
    (16 bits for each), and the message field. A receiver MUST
    successfully read that many octets Total retrieve the complete
    message instance before processing the Babel message.

    Babel Data Unit Format (one tick mark represents one bit position):

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                           Total Length                        |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                           Command code                        |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                         Babel Message Instance                |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+//-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    Total Length (16 bits): The total length of the Babel data unit
    measured in octets in network (big endian) byte order.  The octets
    contained in this field MUST NOT be included in the total length
    calculation.

    Command code (16 bits): The code the packet command. The octets
    contained in this field MUST NOT be included in the total length
    calculation.
    
    Babel Message Instance (variable length): The Babel message instance
    carried in the data unit (big endian).

5.  TCP Transport Considerations

    This protocol addresses each of the considerations using a
    combination of features described in this document and features
    provided by TCP as follows:
    
    -   TCP includes features to provide reliability, flow control,
        ordered delivery, and congestion control. Section 1.5 of RFC 793
        [RFC0793] describes these features in detail; congestion control
        principles are described further in RFC 2581 [RFC2581] and RFC
        2914 [RFC2914]. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, and
        Section 2 of this document describes how EPP sessions are mapped
        to TCP connections.
    
    -   Sections 2 and 3 of this document describe how the stateful
        nature of Babel protocol is preserved through managed sessions
        and controlled message exchanges.

RFC 42              Babel communication protocol            October 2013


    -   Pipelining is possible with TCP, though batch-oriented
        processing (combining multiple Babel commands in a single data
        unit) is not permitted.

    -   Section 4 of this document describes features to frame data
        units by explicitly specifying the number of octets used to
        represent a data unit.

6.  TCP commands descriptions

    A CMSG is a packet sent from client to server.
    A SMSG is a packet sent from server to client.
    The hexa value after the command name is the command value.
    Fields type:
        -   string, one Byte by character terminated by a null Byte.
        -   int8, one signed Byte
        -   uint8, one unsigned Byte
        -   int16, two signed Bytes
        -   uint16, two unsigned Bytes
        -   int32, four signed Bytes
        -   uint32, four unsigned Bytes
        -   int64, height signed Bytes
        -   uint64, height unsigned Bytes
        -   float, four Bytes
        -   double, height Bytes


    6.1.    Globals commands

    -   SMSG ping(0x0004), data: none.
        The client should answer with a CMSG pong(0x0005), data: none.

    6.2.    Auth commands

    -   CMSG auth(0x0001), data: string(username), string(sha1 password)
        the server should answer with and SMSG auth_result(0x0002),
        data: uint8(result). The result can be:
            - 0, successfully authed
            - 1, invalide username / password
            - 2, internal error

    -   CMSG logout(0x0003), data: none.
        the server should not answer.
